# 💯 100 Days of Code – C Programming Journey

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** challenge!  
This repository contains my daily coding progress, written entirely in **C language**.  
Each folder (from `day1` to `day100`) includes 1–2 C programs that I wrote while learning and improving my problem-solving skills.

## 🚀 About This Challenge
The **100 Days of Code** challenge is my personal commitment to code every day, build consistency, and strengthen my fundamentals in C programming.

Every day includes:
- 🧠 **Practice problems** to improve logic building  
- 💻 **Hands-on C programs**  
- 📈 **Progress tracking** to see improvement over time
